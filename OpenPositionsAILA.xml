    <title>PhD in Proof Theory</title>
    <number>1</number>
    <type>phd</type>
    <description>
    The Department of Informatics at the University of Sussex (Brighton, UK) invites applications for highly motivated candidates interested in PhD positions in Logic (Proof Theory).
    The ideal candidate has a Master's degree in Mathematics, Computer Science or Philosophy with experience in Logic (preferably in Proof Theory). 
    The position has a duration of 3.5 years ideally starting in September 2024.
    The hired candidate will be part of the Foundations of Software Systems group ( https://www.sussex.ac.uk/foss/ ), a dynamic group in Theoretical Computer Science which is currently growing and has recently hired various young researchers.

    The project aims at studying the problem of proof equivalence and its applications.
    The problem of proof equivalence, which recently came to the forefront after the discovery of the 24th Hilbert problem, deals with deciding whether two logical arguments should be considered as the same proof, providing theoretical foundations for notions of program equivalences.
    To this end, the project will investigate novel notions of proof equivalence in various logical systems through the lens of proof theory. Emphasis will be given to the study of proof systems allowing canonical representations of proofs (e.g., Hughes' combinatorial proofs and Girard's proof nets). Moreover, the project plans to establish connections between proof equivalence and games, both in the sense of dialogical games (Lorenz and Lorenzen) and game semantics (Abramsky, Hyland and Ong).
    According to the interest of the candidate, applications to interoperability and usability of automated theorem prover and proof assistant, or applications to the theory of programming languages may be investigated.


    Applicants interested in the study of proof theory are encouraged to get in touch with Dr. Matteo Acclavio for additional information and informal inquiries.

    <title>Postdoc in algorithmic and quantitative study of data structures</title>
    <number>1</number>
    <type>post</type>
    <description>
        Our project consists of an algorithmic and quantitative study of classical data structures from computer science under the prism of combinatorics. In the last decade many improvements have been achieved in order to characterize the modeling of these data structures as directed acyclic graphs (or DAGs) combinatorially, paving the way for the analysis of objects induced by compaction procedures: in particular, we will focus on Boolean circuits and decision diagrams. The project thus focuses on considering new types of objects in the combinatorial setting. For some of them, even a proper specification is missing and it could be a major challenge to find one. A further challenge is to extend the generating function algebra to these new settings.
        To apply, please, send CV + scientific project (in relation with the project) + any letters of recommendation + possible labs affiliations to Antoine GENITRINI.

    <title>PhD in Programming Languages</title>
    <number>1</number>
    <type>phd</type>
    <description>
        This position is tied to the ERC Consolidator Project “Choreographies for Distributed Systems: Reasoning, Expressivity, and Development (CHORDS)”. The project aims at introducing new language abstractions, formal models, and software tools for radically changing how we can reason about and develop realistic distributed systems. To this end, the project will establish a collaborative team that will investigate novel theoretical foundations and a formally-verified toolchain for the new paradigm of choreographic programming. The successful candidate will work with the project’s principal investigator (Prof. Fabrizio Montesi), who is a pioneer of the paradigm, and join one of the most prominent international research groups in the topic (the ACP section).
        The ideal candidate has an MSc in Computer Science and experience in at least one of the following areas (acquired, for example, by following courses or through work on an MSc thesis): Theory of programming languages, Compilers. Concurrent and distributed systems, Logical methods in computer science, Interactive theorem provers.
