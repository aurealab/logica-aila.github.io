# Open positions collected by the AILA members

This is a collaborative repository of the members of the Associazione Italiana di Logica e sue Applicazioni (AILA, https://www.ailalogica.it/ ).
It contains:
- an archive of the open positions in logic collected by the members of  AILA;
- a javascript allowing to load and display the positions collected in the archive, divided into PhD, Postdoc and Permanent positions

Whoever interested in promote the open positions collected in this archive can include in their own webpage:
- an element with id "noticeBoardOpenPositionsAILA" 
- the javascript populating the element

It would suffice to include the following line of code in the page:
```html
<div id="noticeBoardOpenPositionsAILA"></div><script src="https://logica-aila.github.io/listOpenPositionsAILA.js"></script>
```
